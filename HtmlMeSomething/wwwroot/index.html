                              <p>
                                  My first job was during university years, I worked at RR Donnelley factory so I could learn more about printing technologies.
                                  Then after graduation I started my first full time job as a production artist in publishing house.
                                  Then I came to US for graphic design internship. From being graphic designer I shifted to wed designer and then to web developer. Now I am software developer.
                                  I'm also learning more and utllizing some UX design skills I got from UX course at LaunchCode.

                              <p>
                                  I really enjoy drawing. Recentry I started trying watercolor and I'm loving it. The way water mixes up with paint is really amazing. You can get very creative with this type of paint.
